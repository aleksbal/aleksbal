### ⚡ Fun Fact
When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me:
- Repairing vintage audio gear (because modern sound just isn’t retro enough!),
- Crafting the perfect pizza in my self-made oven (yes, it’s as epic as it sounds 🍕),
- Or experimenting with Chinese cooking (currently on a quest to master the wok!).
